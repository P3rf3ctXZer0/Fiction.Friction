*Welcome to Fiction Friction a world created by you. This is a mod pack that will use the latest version of forge as well as Minecraft as a base. I am hoping that this project will be my final title as it allows me the flexibility to make whatever I desire. I have gone many days thinking that I could maintain multiple projects only to get creatively burnt out. This is my magnum opus and I truly hope you enjoy your time here. I would like to make it clear in advance none of my packs are meant to be played in single player. You can still do so but if you suffer performance issues due to not being the optimized server I only ask you accept the consequence*

![](https://i.imgur.com/b8OArlU.png) **Automatable** = Almost everything in the pack can be automated. Make resources and recipes with ease.

![](https://i.imgur.com/b8OArlU.png) **Build with Ease** = Want to make amazingly large structures very fast? Looking for slopes and other wonderful shapes? Can't quiet find the shape you are looking for? If you said yes to any of these; you won't be disappointed.

![](https://i.imgur.com/b8OArlU.png) **Lots to Explore** = Biomes, Creatures, and Dungeons a plenty. I couldn't stand the barren feel of vanilla. I even found a mod that adds all the caves and cliffs update stuff.

![](https://i.imgur.com/b8OArlU.png) **Inventory Management** = Sort and shuffle inventory easily. Combine your inventory with the Refined Storage System and have a wonderful way to do so much.

![](https://i.imgur.com/b8OArlU.png) **Magic Based** = I really enjoy complex spells that do cool and unique things. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/b8OArlU.png) **Multiplayer Ready** Inside the pack is a server file. You don't have to ask where the server is because it is included. I also like to make sure the server as a whole does not collapse under its own weight.

![](https://i.imgur.com/b8OArlU.png) **Open to Suggestions** = I am open to ideas and suggestions. Just make an issue titled "Mod Suggestion - Modname" and in the description box just add the reason why it is needed. I am going to try and avoid duplicate or overlapping mods. Sometimes you just have to learn something new.

![](https://i.imgur.com/b8OArlU.png) **Pokemobs** = Currently since Pixelmon is not actually updated I have Pokecube because I love Mons. I do have pokecube in the meantime. They act more like vanilla mobs though because the dev refuses to get closer to the source material.

![](https://i.imgur.com/b8OArlU.png) **Renewable Resources** = My packs all have something very wonderful in common you don't always need to travel the universe to find what you are looking for. Just get 4 of any item in most cases and a lot of Infernium.

![](https://i.imgur.com/b8OArlU.png) **Scaling Difficulty** = As you play the game it will both get easier and harder. Difficulty is very dynamic.

![](https://i.imgur.com/b8OArlU.png) **Semi-Realistic** = Eat foods gain health. Eat the same food too much and gain nothing.

![](https://i.imgur.com/b8OArlU.png) **Technological** = This modpack is chalked full of wonderful tech mods.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/tHGfaoN.png)

*It might not seem like I can make a great pack because I cannot code but honestly I can. I am very good at detecting and squashing bugs. I really just want the perfect Minecraft experience for myself. I also want others to have a good time as well. I really love the creativity Minecraft allows us to have and even though I am not a world class builder or even that smart I don't let either of those factors stop me from expressing myself. I play for fun and also to enjoy expirementing with different mekanisms. I do plan on adding Pixelmon whenever it is updated. Unfortnately right now it is trapped on 1.12.2 Also most of the art is not mine or heavily edited I am not artistic; I try though.*
