*Welcome to Fiction Friction a world created by you. This is a mod pack that will use the latest version of forge as well as Minecraft as a base. I am hoping that this project will be my final title as it allows me the flexibility to make whatever I desire. I have gone many days thinking that I could maintain multiple projects only to get creatively burnt out. This is my magnum opus and I truly hope you enjoy your time here.*

**Adventure Filled** = I want all sorts of structures dungeons and creatures to spawn. I want exploring to exciting and players to have a real experience.

**Automation** = I want players who progress to a certain point be allowed to easily automate recipes and other things.

**Building Ease** = I want this pack to be builder friendly. This means people of all skill levels and patience should easily be able to build whatever thier heart desires.

**Fun** = No matter what a player is playing the pack for I want to be fun.

**Scaling Difficulty** = I want the game to increase in difficulty the longer you play. I want creatures to pose a greater challenge the stronger a player gets or how much that player has progressed.

*It might not seem like I can make a great pack because I cannot code but honestly I can. I am very good at detecting and squashing bugs. I really just want the perfect Minecraft experience for myself. I also want others to have a good time as well. I really love the creativity minecraft allows us to have and even though I am not a world class builder or even that smart I don't let either of those factors stop me from expressing myself. I play for fun and also to enjoy expirementing with different mekanisms. I do plan on adding Pixelmon whenever it is updated. Unfortnately right now it is trapped on 1.12.2*
