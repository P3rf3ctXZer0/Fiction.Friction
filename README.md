*Welcome to Fiction Friction a world created by you. This is a mod pack that will use the latest version of forge as well as Minecraft as a base. I am hoping that this project will be my final title as it allows me the flexibility to make whatever I desire. I have gone many days thinking that I could maintain multiple projects only to get creatively burnt out. This is my magnum opus and I truly hope you enjoy your time here. I would like to make it clear in advance none of my packs are meant to be played in single player. You can still do so but if you suffer performance issues due to not being the optimized server I only ask you accept the consequence*

**Automatable** = Almost everything in the pack can be automated. Make resources and recipes with ease.

**Lots to Explore** = Biomes, Creatures, and Dungeons a plenty. I couldn't stand the barren feel of vanilla. I even found a mod that adds all the caves and cliffs update stuff.

**Inventory Management** = ?

*It might not seem like I can make a great pack because I cannot code but honestly I can. I am very good at detecting and squashing bugs. I really just want the perfect Minecraft experience for myself. I also want others to have a good time as well. I really love the creativity minecraft allows us to have and even though I am not a world class builder or even that smart I don't let either of those factors stop me from expressing myself. I play for fun and also to enjoy expirementing with different mekanisms. I do plan on adding Pixelmon whenever it is updated. Unfortnately right now it is trapped on 1.12.2*
