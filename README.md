## Important Information

- Many users of windows 10 have reported that the pack just fails to start ... it does work just use process manager and kill it if you have issues a simple way to know if it is working is if you have memory usage slowly going up and at least 10 percent cpu usage. If your usage reads 0-3% or less it has most likely hung just watch it and count to 5 secs. All testing is done on windows 11 pro with [adoptium java 17 latest](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases "https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases").

*Welcome to Fiction Friction a world created by you. This is a mod pack that will almost always be using the latest version of Forge as well as Minecraft as a base. I am hoping that this project will be my final title as it allows me the flexibility to make whatever I desire. I have gone many days thinking that I could maintain multiple projects only to get creatively burnt out. This is my magnum opus and I truly hope you enjoy your time here.*

*I would like to say thank you to all the skilled coders that allowed this to even be possible. Thank you so much. As a reminder I do not own a single mod as I am unable to code due to mental challenges with mathematical processing.*

## Ultimately whatever you dream it to be. 
If a mod you want is missing you can write a ticket and if it is not a mod I am aware has issues I will happily add it so long as I don't have anything that currently adds that function. So what are you waiting for come play some Modded Minecraft :D

## Final Notes

Whatever you set Minecraft's ram to please know to remember the rule of plus 2. It means you can set Minecraft to use 4GB but windows will always use plus 6GB equaling a total of 10GB physically in use. That means to have a working computer you would need at least 10GB physical ram to even play the game and have your pc function. So you cannot run a 6GB pack on 8GB of ram because there will be nothing left for windows.

Also if you need a server start bat I made a universal bat https://github.com/P3rf3ctXZer0/Minecraft-Universal-server_start.bat its based on the one packed with serversync.
